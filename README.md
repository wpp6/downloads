Repository for the downloadable source code in the book, "Learn Harmony v3 for PIC32MZ"

## PURPOSE

This repository contains all of the source code used in the book, **Learn Harmony v3 for PIC32MZ**, by Bill Petrick, (c) 2020 (available from Amazon.com).  All of the source code in the book are labeled with a figure number.  I have copied all of the figures containing source code into files, one for each chapter, and uploaded the files to this github repository.  

When you are working the examples in the book, you will want to copy the source code into the appropriate MPLAB X project file.  There are two easy methods to get the source code from this repository into the correct MPLAB X project file: (1) a simple cut-and-paste from the github file into the MPLAB X editor, or (2) download the zip-file (containing all of the individual chapters) to your local machine, unzip the files and then copy and paste the parts you want.

Suppose you are working on the project in Chapter 5 and the instructions say to replace the contents of app.h with what is shown in Figure 5-14. 

### Example - Method 1:

1. In MPLAB X, open the app.h file in the editor and delete all of the file contents. 
2. Go to this repository (at https://github.com/BillP/Learn_Hv3) and select the file, FiguresChapter5, to bring up the github editor.  
3. Scroll down to Figure 5-14.  
4. Copy from the file header comment down to the "End Figure 5-14".  
5. Go to the MPLAB X editor and paste the copied text into the app.h file.  

### Example - Method 2:

* Go to this repository (at https://github.com/BillP/Learn_Hv3) and select the zip-file, Chapters.zip.  
* Click on the download button to the right of the name.  
* On your local machine, move the zip file to where you want it and unzip it to show all of the chapters containing source code.
* Open the file, FiguresChapter5, with your favorite text editor. 
* Scroll down to Figure 5-14.  
* Copy from the file header comment down to the "End Figure 5-14".  
* Go to the MPLAB X editor and paste the copied text into the app.h file.
